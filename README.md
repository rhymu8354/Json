# Json

This is a library which implements [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159),
"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format".

## Usage

The `Json::Json` class is a utility for reading and writing strings of data in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.  It can parse a complete data structure from a JSON string, or generate a JSON string from a data structure.

## Supported platforms / recommended toolchains

This is a portable C++11 library which depends only on the C++11 compiler and standard library, so it should be supported on almost any platform.  The following are recommended toolchains for popular platforms.

* Windows -- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Microsoft Visual C++)
* Linux -- clang or gcc
* MacOS -- Xcode (clang)

## Building

This library is not intended to stand alone.  It is intended to be included in a larger solution which uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to generate the build system and build applications which will link with the library.

There are two distinct steps in the build process:

1. Generation of the build system, using CMake
2. Compiling, linking, etc., using CMake-compatible toolchain

### Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.8 or newer
* C++11 toolchain compatible with CMake for your development platform (e.g. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows)
* [SystemAbstractions](https://github.com/rhymu8354/SystemAbstractions.git) - a
  cross-platform adapter library for system services whose APIs vary from one
  operating system to another
* [Utf8](https://github.com/rhymu8354/Utf8.git) - a library which implements
  [RFC 3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629), "UTF-8 (Unicode
  Transformation Format)".

### Build system generation

Generate the build system using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) from the solution root.  For example:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A "x64" ..
```

### Compiling, linking, et cetera

Either use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or your toolchain's IDE to build.
For [CMake](https://cmake.org/):

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
```
